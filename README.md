# SmartPark â€“ Design and Analysis

## Project Overview
SmartPark is a real-time, camera-based parking finder system designed for large outdoor areas such as university campuses, city streets, and hospital parking lots. It helps drivers quickly locate available parking spaces, reducing time, fuel consumption, and congestion.

The system uses computer vision and edge computing to detect vacant parking spots from live camera feeds. The information is processed locally, sent to a backend system, stored in the cloud, and displayed on a mobile or web application in real time. This approach eliminates the need for costly ground sensors and makes the system scalable, accurate, and affordable.

## Elevator Pitch
Finding parking in busy areas is time-consuming and frustrating. SmartPark solves this problem by combining live camera feeds, AI-powered vehicle detection, and real-time data updates. Drivers can instantly see which spots are free through an easy-to-use app or website, even in large, complex outdoor environments.

## High-Level Architecture
The SmartPark system is made up of multiple layers that work together:

1. **Camera Feed (Input Layer)**  
   CCTV or IP cameras capture live footage of parking areas and send it to the edge device for processing.

2. **Edge Processing (Edge Layer)**  
   Low-power devices such as Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson process frames using YOLOv5 or CNN models to detect vehicles and determine slot occupancy.

3. **Computer Vision Module (Processing Layer)**  
   OpenCV handles frame extraction and preprocessing, while PyTorch or TensorFlow runs the trained detection model. Detected slot statuses are sent as JSON payloads to the backend.

4. **Backend and API Gateway (Middleware Layer)**  
   A Flask or Django REST API receives data from the vision module and responds to frontend requests with real-time slot information.

5. **Real-Time Database (Data Storage Layer)**  
   Slot status and metadata are stored in Firebase Realtime Database or PostgreSQL for fast access and synchronization.

6. **Mobile/Web Application (User Interface Layer)**  
   A Flutter-based mobile app and a ReactJS web app display live parking maps with color-coded slots (green for vacant, red for occupied, gray for unavailable).

7. **Deployment Infrastructure (DevOps Layer)**  
   All backend and vision components are containerized using Docker and deployed on cloud services (AWS, GCP) or on-premises servers. Monitoring tools track uptime and performance.

## Risk Analysis
- **Lighting and Weather Conditions:** Poor lighting or bad weather can affect detection accuracy.  
- **Camera Placement:** Incorrect camera angles may cause blind spots.  
- **Network Reliability:** Real-time updates depend on stable network connections.  
- **Scalability:** Adding more locations requires additional edge devices and cameras.  
- **Privacy Concerns:** Camera feeds must be handled according to privacy laws and regulations.
